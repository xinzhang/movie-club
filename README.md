## The Scenario
John Johnson hosts a weekly movie event with his local Tom Cruise Fan club called "John Johnsons Cruisey Movie Monday". He's asked you to build a website where he can either search for a specific movie or display a list of Tom Cruise's movies for his audience to select from.


## What we need you to do
1. Read the above for what's needed
2. Setup your react project. Feel free to pick the tools you'd want to use
3. Build a search component that connects to https://112qaej5y9.execute-api.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/dev/graphql and can either search for a specific movie or display a list to match the criteria above
4. Push source code to this repo

### What we're looking for
1. Ability to build a React component from scratch
2. Integration with an API endpoint
3. Ability to style the component (without Bootstrap) feel free to style it how you want
4. Any cool things you feel like adding is a nice bonus

### Tech details
- GraphQL Endpoint: https://112qaej5y9.execute-api.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/dev/graphql
- GraphQL Playground: https://fireql.dev/?url=https://112qaej5y9.execute-api.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/dev/graphql
- Note: The MovieDB endpoint only allows 40 requests every 10 seconds
